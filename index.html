            Training proficient Technology Coaches (TCs), to work with some of the most vulnerable students in our
            school system, is a mammoth task that requires a great deal of both planning and preparation. Any
            implementation of such training should be rooted in research on adult learning, leadership theories, and
            data-informed decision-making. This paper outlines a strategy that seeks to accomplish that by relying on
            the principles of ADDIE to create a self-correcting onboarding process for new TCs.

        <p class="text-wrap">
            As an organization committed to levelling the playing field to learning-disabled (LD) students, we rely
            heavily on our expertise in assistive technology (AT) to teach students both the tools and the strategies
            that allow them to access their curriculum and become independent learners. This expertise is gained through
            an onboarding program that introduces new hires to our organization’s values, our approach to teaching
            sessions, and our learning strategies.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Unfortunately, the onboarding program contains a number of deficiencies that manifest themselves in the type
            and amount of support that new hires typically require after finishing their onboarding. Inexperienced <abbr
                title="Technology Coaches">TCs</abbr>
            usually use the company messaging system to request support from their managers and/or co-workers on a
            number of common topics. This method of requesting assistance is not ideal for a whole host of reasons.
            First, it takes time for our co-workers to write a full description of the problem that allows for a
            solution to be provided. This is time that is lost from the session and might jeopardize its status as
            session per our contract with the school board. Second, employees might inadvertently fail to
            provide relevant details and crucial contexts that means an inaccurate solution is provided, which can
            further exacerbate the problem. Third, managers and veteran employees do not have a dedicated time set aside
            to field questions from their co-workers. This means that they might simply not be available to answer
            questions and provide support, or they will need to temporarily put off their own task in order to
            troubleshoot. What usually tends to happen is a combination of the two events; veteran employees switch
            between providing support to their co-workers and being unavailable as they are conducting their own
            sessions. These outcomes are unacceptable; new employees should not be left to fend for themselves by trying
            to troubleshoot their own problems. However, it is not reasonable to expect veteran employees and managers
            to always be there to support new hires.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But why do new employees require so much assistance in the first place? The answer to that lies in how the
            curriculum is structured and its incongruity with the type of skills that TCs utilized in the field. The
            curriculum focuses on a number of high-level topics provided through courses on the company website while
            relying on shadowing days to teach specific skills to new employees.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="page mx-auto mt-3 bg-white border border-secondary shadow">
    <div class="m-5">
        <p class="text-wrap">
            The problem with this approach is that
            shadowing days are by their very nature an unstructured learning environment where what gets taught in it is
            unpredictable and unreliable. If the new employee is “lucky” then they might get to observe and learn how a
            veteran employee uses a specific assistive technology (AT) or solves a problem that they encountered during
            the session. It goes without saying that this is simply not an optimum way to teach TCs how to use AT tools
            or solve some of the most common problems that they might run into. What is sorely missing is formalized
            training on the actual assistive technology tools that TCs will use extensively and the processes that they
            can apply should they run into any challenges. This can include procedures such as how to cancel a session
            if an LD student is not available, how to work with uncooperative students or busy school contacts, and how
            to troubleshoot technical issues that will inevitably arise during a session.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The problems with the onboarding program go beyond its content. The program does not have a formalized
            process that evaluates its effectiveness and rectifies its errors. Incorrect or outdated information might
            linger in the curriculum without an active process of continuously evaluating its content. This is
            compounded by the fact that TCs work in the field of technology, and technology changes rapidly as new
            updates get released and our client school board modify their software licenses.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It would be ideal if new employees were equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to not only
            independently solve problems, but also avoid them in the first place. In this document, I would like to put
            forth a strategic plan for your consideration that overhauls the way we train our newest members. I will
            begin by introducing the strategy and what the research literature says about it. I will also supplement the
            plan with supporting evidence that justify why these steps were chosen and how they helped orient the
            strategic plan. I will then outline a set of steps to align the onboarding curriculum with the needs of new
            hires.

        <p class="text-wrap">
            To address these aforementioned challenges, we need to overhaul our onboarding program. This overhaul has to
            be the product of a thoughtful and deliberate process that takes the input of relevant stakeholders into
            account; this is because the content of the curriculum should reflect the skills utilized by TCs in the
            field. The overhaul should also lead to a learning experience that keeps up with changing processes and
            technologies. A strategy with the acronym ADDIE checks both of these boxes. ADDIE is an instructional design
            strategy comprised of the following components: “Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation”
            (Chevalier, 2006, p.10). ADDIE was chosen due to its flexibility and proven record of accomplishment of
            imparting knowledge onto learners in various organizations from the US military to commercial enterprises
            (Allen, 2006). ADDIE is a staple of the instructional design field that deals primarily with adult learners
            and a telling example of its strength can be found in the fact that even veteran learning specialists, with
            years of experience, include principles of ADDIE in their instructional design process (York & Ertmer,
            2016).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            There are plenty of examples of ADDIE being successfully employed to create educational content for a wide
            range of adult audiences. For example, Peterson (2003) employed the ADDIE steps to design and create a
            Master’s level course, and the course students themselves used the strategy as a scaffold when working on
            their own course projects. Peterson explained that using the Analysis step of ADDIE both puts the learners’
            needs at the forefront of the course design and makes use of that analysis throughout the steps of the
            strategy (Peterson, 2003). This elevates course design to go beyond being “teacher-centric approach”
            (Peterson, 2003, p.228). The evaluation stage revealed that the students rated the course as effective while
            also providing feedback about what aspects of the design can be improved (Peteson, 2003). Much like
            Peterson, Al-Bulushi & Ismail (2017) made use of ADDIE when developing a university teacher preparation
            program. The authors of this study conducted a comprehensive analysis phase to glean the learners’
            perspective and identify weaknesses within the current program (the instructional gap). Their analysis
            revealed a number of pertinent factors that impact the effectiveness of the program such as the roles of
            learners, relationship between the stakeholders, and the causes of performance gaps.

<div class="page mx-auto mt-3 bg-white border border-secondary shadow">
    <div class="m-5">
        <p class="text-wrap">
            With a goal of
            fostering collaboration and reciprocity, Zhang (2020) set about using ADDIE to create an English language
            course where there are effective means of communication between teachers and learners to facilitate the
            language acquisition. ADDIE came into play through analysis of the learner needs and teacher capacity, which
            allowed for the design and development of instructional content that is appropriate for the student as it
            took into account their language skill, learning willingness, and goals (Zhang, 2020).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A common theme underpinning this research is the authors’ use of ADDIE as a cornerstone of the process of
            creating relevant and responsive educational experiences. Through analysis, they acquainted themselves with
            their learners and then designed and developed instructional experiences that built upon their examination.
            This fits perfectly with our goals, since addressing the learners' needs is a major objective of ours, and
            we will use the strategy to create an iterative, board-specific content that addresses challenges shared by
            new employees, while also formatively evaluating the effectiveness of the material based on the feedback of
            those who use it in their day-to-day job.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">Anchoring ADDIE within Knowle’s Theory of Andragogy:</p>
        <p class="text-wrap">
            Another strength of this approach is that it is anchored in highly regarded Adult Learning Theories,
            specifically Knowle’s theory of Andragogy. According to Knowle, adults learn best when the content they are
            learning is relevant to their work; That’s because Knowle held that adult learners are problem centered
            (McGrath, 2009). For that reason, adults will be more motivated to acquire information that helps them solve
            everyday problems. ADDIE fulfills that goal by taking the input of TCs and incorporating it into the content
            of the curriculum. Second it evaluates the effectiveness of the content to keep up to date with the changing
            work context so that it continues to provide accurate and relevant information to TCs.

            There are two sets of data that I would like to share. The first one is survey results that was conducted
            with employees and second is summary of the number and type of questions that were submitted by employees to
            the company chat. These data were collected for the purpose of gaining a better picture of the efficacy of
            the onboarding program in its current state. The survey was structured to inquire about our colleagues’
            opinions of the onboarding instructional content, and what can be done to make it better. The survey was
            conducted in-person while the data were compiled from company chat logs.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Survey respondents indicated that including content on the appropriate cancellation
            procedure is the most popular demand. This was followed by needs to learn more about
            completing session reports (STMS) and including more instruction on the various <abbr

            <br/>
            <br/>
            Examination of the chat logs revealed that requiring help with using AT was the most common topic.
            This was followed by questions on how to correctly cancel a session, how to resolve technical issues, and
            which
