            Training proficient Technology Coaches (TCs), to work with some of the most vulnerable students in our
            school system, is a mammoth task that requires a great deal of both planning and preparation. Any
            implementation of such training should be rooted in research on adult learning, leadership theories, and
            data-informed decision-making. This paper outlines a strategy that seeks to accomplish that by relying on
            the principles of ADDIE to create a self-correcting onboarding process for new TCs.

            As an organization committed to levelling the playing field to learning-disabled (LD) students, we rely
            heavily on our expertise in <span class="my-tooltip">assistive technology (AT)<span>A collection of board-approved software that can compensate for an academic skill. TCs teach students how to use this software</span></span> to teach students both the tools and the strategies
            that allow them to access their curriculum and become independent learners. This expertise is gained through
            an onboarding program that introduces new hires to our organization’s values, our approach to teaching
            sessions, and our learning strategies.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Unfortunately, the onboarding program contains a number of deficiencies that manifest themselves in the type
            and amount of support that new hires typically require after finishing their onboarding. Inexperienced <abbr
                title="Technology Coaches">TCs</abbr>
            usually use the company messaging system to request support from their managers and/or co-workers on a
            number of common topics. This method of requesting assistance is not ideal for a whole host of reasons.
            First, it takes time for our co-workers to write a full description of the problem that allows for a
            solution to be provided. This is time that is lost from the session and might jeopardize its status as
            completed per our contract with the school board. Second, employees might inadvertently fail to
            provide relevant details and crucial contexts that means an inaccurate solution is provided, which can
            further exacerbate the problem. Third, managers and veteran employees do not have a dedicated time set aside
            to field questions from their co-workers. This means that they might simply not be available to answer
            questions and provide support, or they will need to temporarily put off their own task in order to
            troubleshoot. What usually tends to happen is a combination of the two events; veteran employees switch
            between providing support to their co-workers and being unavailable as they are conducting their own
            sessions. These outcomes are unacceptable; new employees should not be left to fend for themselves by trying
            to troubleshoot their own problems. However, it is not reasonable to expect veteran employees and managers
            to always be there to support new hires.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But why do new employees require so much assistance in the first place? The answer to that lies in how the
            curriculum is structured and its incongruity with the type of skills that TCs utilized in the field. The
            curriculum focuses on a number of high-level topics provided through courses on the company website while
            relying on shadowing days to teach specific skills to new employees.
        </p>

<div class="page mx-auto mt-3 bg-white border border-secondary shadow">
    <div class="m-5 d-flex flex-column">
        <p class="text-wrap flex-grow-1">
            The problem with this approach is that
            shadowing days are by their very nature an unstructured learning environment where what gets taught in it is
            unpredictable and unreliable. If the new employee is “lucky” then they might get to observe and learn how a
            veteran employee uses a specific AT or solves a problem that they encountered during
            the session. It goes without saying that this is simply not an optimum way to teach TCs how to use AT tools
            or solve some of the most common problems that they might run into. What is sorely missing is formalized
            training on the actual assistive technology tools that TCs will use extensively and the processes that they
            can apply should they run into any challenges. This can include procedures such as how to cancel a session
            if an LD student is not available, how to work with uncooperative students or busy school contacts, and how
            to troubleshoot technical issues that will inevitably arise during a session.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The problems with the onboarding program go beyond its content. The program does not have a formalized
            process that evaluates its effectiveness and rectifies its errors. Incorrect or outdated information might
            linger in the curriculum without an active process of continuously evaluating its content. This is
            compounded by the fact that TCs work in the field of technology, and technology changes rapidly as new
            updates get released and our client school board modify their software licenses.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It would be ideal if new employees were equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to not only
            independently solve problems, but also avoid them in the first place. In this document, I would like to put
            forth a strategic plan for your consideration that overhauls the way we train our newest members. I will
            begin by introducing the strategy and what the research literature says about it. I will also supplement the
            plan with supporting evidence that justify why these steps were chosen and how they helped orient the
            strategic plan. I will then outline a set of steps to align the onboarding curriculum with the needs of new
            hires.

            To address these aforementioned challenges, we need to overhaul our onboarding program. This overhaul has to
            be the product of a thoughtful and deliberate process that takes the input of relevant stakeholders into
            account; this is because the content of the curriculum should reflect the skills utilized by TCs in the
            field. The overhaul should also lead to a learning experience that keeps up with changing processes and
            technologies. A strategy with the acronym ADDIE checks both of these boxes. ADDIE is an instructional design
            strategy comprised of the following components: “Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation”
            (Chevalier, 2006, p.10). ADDIE was chosen due to its flexibility and proven record of accomplishment of
            imparting knowledge onto learners in various organizations from the US military to commercial enterprises
            (Allen, 2006). ADDIE is a staple of the instructional design field that deals primarily with adult learners
            and a telling example of its strength can be found in the fact that even veteran learning specialists, with
            years of experience, include principles of ADDIE in their instructional design process (York & Ertmer,
            2016).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            There are plenty of examples of ADDIE being successfully employed to create educational content for a wide
            range of adult audiences. For example, Peterson (2003) employed the ADDIE steps to design and create a
            Master’s level course, and the course students themselves used the strategy as a scaffold when working on
            their own course projects. Peterson explained that using the Analysis step of ADDIE both puts the learners’
            needs at the forefront of the course design and makes use of that analysis throughout the steps of the
            strategy (Peterson, 2003). This elevates course design to go beyond being “teacher-centric approach”
            (Peterson, 2003, p.228). The evaluation stage revealed that the students rated the course as effective while
            also providing feedback about what aspects of the design can be improved (Peteson, 2003). Much like
            Peterson, Al-Bulushi & Ismail (2017) made use of ADDIE when developing a university teacher preparation
            program. The authors of this study conducted a comprehensive analysis phase to glean the learners’
            perspective and identify weaknesses within the current program (the instructional gap). Their analysis
            revealed a number of pertinent factors that impact the effectiveness of the program such as the roles of
            learners, relationship between the stakeholders, and the causes of performance gaps.

            With a goal of
            fostering collaboration and reciprocity, Zhang (2020) set about using ADDIE to create an English language
            course where there are effective means of communication between teachers and learners to facilitate the
            language acquisition. ADDIE came into play through analysis of the learner needs and teacher capacity, which
            allowed for the design and development of instructional content that is appropriate for the student as it
            took into account their language skill, learning willingness, and goals (Zhang, 2020).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A common theme underpinning this research is the authors’ use of ADDIE as a cornerstone of the process of
            creating relevant and responsive educational experiences. Through analysis, they acquainted themselves with
            their learners and then designed and developed instructional experiences that built upon their examination.
            This fits perfectly with our goals, since addressing the learners' needs is a major objective of ours, and
            we will use the strategy to create an iterative, board-specific content that addresses challenges shared by
            new employees, while also formatively evaluating the effectiveness of the material based on the feedback of
            those who use it in their day-to-day job.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">Anchoring ADDIE within Knowle’s Theory of Andragogy:</p>
        <p class="text-wrap flex-grow-1">
            Another strength of this approach is that it is anchored in highly regarded Adult Learning Theories,
            specifically Knowle’s theory of Andragogy. According to Knowle, adults learn best when the content they are
            learning is relevant to their work; That’s because Knowle held that adult learners are problem centered
            (McGrath, 2009). For that reason, adults will be more motivated to acquire information that helps them solve
            everyday problems. ADDIE fulfills that goal by taking the input of TCs and incorporating it into the content
            of the curriculum. Second it evaluates the effectiveness of the content to keep up to date with the changing
            work context so that it continues to provide accurate and relevant information to TCs.

            the company chat. These data were collected for the purpose of gaining a better picture of the efficacy of
            the onboarding program in its current state. The survey was structured to inquire about our colleagues’
            opinions of the onboarding instructional content, and what can be done to make it better. The survey was
            conducted in-person while the data were compiled from company chat logs.

            <br/>
            Survey respondents indicated that including content on the appropriate cancellation

            completing session reports (STMS) and including more instruction on the various <abbr

            organization.</p>
        <p class="lead">1. Analyze:</p>
        <p>Preliminary analysis using the aforementioned survey identified several topics of interest. These will serve
            as an excellent starting point to explore further during focus group meeting and follow-up surveys. The
            analysis phase of ADDIE will rely on three sources of information. The first will be surveys of TCs to
            gather their opinion and expertise on the state of the onboarding issue and how it can be improved. This is
            a vital step as including stakeholders in problem identification and solution is an example of an
            implementation strategy that can both help sustain our program and win stakeholder buy-in (Lyon, 2017).
            Additionally, it allows us to move past the authority structure of the past, where curriculum content was
            determined by management figures who are no longer involved in field work, into a more distributed
            leadership model where the expertise of coaches can be pooled to overcome the limitations of singular
            leaders (Bush & Glover, 2014).
            <br/>

            The second and third sources of information will be gathered from employees' support requests and their
            performance on curriculum tests. These will be further discussed in the evaluation section below. </p>
        <p class="lead">2. Design:</p>
        <p class="flex-grow-1">Using this principle, our onboarding will focus on teaching measurable behavior rather
            than abstract concepts
            or knowledge, and under explicitly defined parameters. An example objective would be demonstrating how to
            change the reading speed and voice of the Text-to-Speech software, independently, and in under 1 minute. The
            content of the learning objectives will be determined based on the findings of the analysis, and they will
            be modified with each loop of ADDIE in order to ensure that the goals of the curriculum match the
            needs of TCs. </p>

        <p class="lead">3. Develop:</p>
        <p>Developing can be done using the <span class="my-tooltip">Articulate 360© suite<span>A collection of software for the creation of interactive learning content. Storyline 360 is the flagship product and an industry standard</span></span>,
            which is one of the most popular
            eLearning authoring tools in-demand by organizations (Peck, 2022). To encourage deeper cognitive processing,
            learning content will be delivered in a conversational style in keep with Mayer’s principles of multimedia
            learning (Mayer, 2005). Much like our analysis, our development process should make use of our understanding
            of knowledge mobilization strategies which enthuse about the need to vary information delivery methods and
            to make training more dynamic (Lyon, 2017). To that end, Storyline 360 will be used to add interactive
            components to learning content to keep them engaging and dynamic. For example, the survey found that TCs
            wanted to learn more about using the STMS. This system can be simulated with Storyline and used as a
            learning tool where TCs get to practice generating reports in a scaffolded environment. </p>
        <p class="lead">4. Implement:</p>
        <p>
            Our organization’s Learning Management System (LMS) will be used to host and deliver learning content to new
            employees. Implementation is divided into two types. The first is the weeklong delivery of instructional
            content throughout onboarding. The second is the distribution of optional job aids and scheduling of regular
            checkup meetings with the regional manager to support the retention of onboarding content. This form of
            post-training support is important to ensure that knowledge mobilization has both high transfer and high
            fidelity relative to its source (Lyon, 2017).

        <p class="lead">5. Evaluate:</p>
        <p class="flex-grow-1">
            ADDIE does not have to be a linear process with evaluation coming at the end. Allen (2006) talks about
            evaluation taking place concurrently with all ADDIE phases. In our context, evaluation and analysis are two
            inseparable phases as data from evaluation feeds directly into our analysis, which begins a new cycle of
            design, development, and implementation.
            We can determine that our intervention is successful when the issues uncovered in the previous iteration of
            ADDIE are

            addressed by the current design and no longer show up as problematic during the evaluation. Kirkpatrick’s
            Learning Evaluation Model will be used to structure and guide this phase. According to Kirkpatrick (1998),
            evaluation can be divided into four levels, the first is the learner’s reaction to training. The second is
            an evaluation of what they learned. The third level is about changes in behaviour as a result of the
            training; and the fourth is strategic examination of the impact on the organization. In our case, level 1 is
            handled by the
            survey and focus groups. Level 2 is done through the creation of embedded quizzes using authoring tools when
            delivering instructional content. Level 3 and 4 are company-wide variables that are obtained from evaluating
            employee behaviour in terms of requesting support, completing sessions, and matching their coaching session
            content the needs of their students. These are ascertained by matching our <abbr
                title="Information Management System">IMS</abbr> with session reports.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Our approach to data collection and decision-making should be informed by what the research says. For
            example, Anderson et al. (2010) talked about the positive impact of using data not just to identify
            problems, but to investigate them further. In our context this translates to using the findings from levels
            2, 3 and 4 data during focus groups and surveys to uncover the root causes of suboptimal performances and
            the best ways to address them. For example, why would new employees be unaware of how to fix the
            unresponsiveness of an OCR tool, or why do level 4 data suggest that there has been an increase in
            incomplete sessions by employees who just finished their onboarding. Second, we should strive to use data to
            challenge the assumptions that underlie our practices, this is what is called “double-loop learning”
            (Anderson et al., 2010, p. 324). This means that we should explicitly express our assumptions and design our
            evaluations to directly test them; do we assume that TCs are already comfortable with using TTS in a number
            of AT software? Then we can include questions in level 2 evaluations that cover this very topic.

        <p class="text-center">
            In conclusion, our survey and company chat requests highlight several weaknesses with our onboarding
            program. These weaknesses translate to excessive requests for support from co-workers. These requests
            demonstrate a lack of knowledge that can be remedied with an overhauled onboarding program. This overhaul,
            however, needs to be done methodically and deliberately; and ADDIE serves as an excellent strategy to carry
            out this task. Our overhaul should make use of our expertise in creating learning experiences using
            authoring tools, and any evaluation should be rooted in well-regarded evaluation frameworks. Ultimately, our
            goal is to be proficient in instructing our learning-disabled students.
